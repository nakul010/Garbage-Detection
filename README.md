# Garbage-Detection

- Currently developing a project, garbage detection robot using computer vision and deep learning techniques to automate waste management processes.

- Trained a custom object detection model using YOLOv7 on 6000 images, enabling the robot to accurately identify and classify different types of garbage in real-time.

- Implementing hardware components, including a Raspberry Pi connected to a motor driver and a camera, to enable real-time video feed for garbage detection. <br>
